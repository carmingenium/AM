```ad-info
title: Link saver for weekly film event
collapse:close
Link can only be set by certain roles (Maybe another function for this to work? setting roles in every server.). Link can be reached by anyone. Link and linkname should be saved so maybe we can save multiple links? (using multiple functions to set, get, and showlist maybe).  
```

```ad-info
title: Countdown for film events.
collapse:close
Could post related links in a certain channel when certain timestamps are reached(1 day, 2 hours, 1 hour etc.)

It would be nice to create documentation for all tasks which explain every aspect of them. This would gives us clear goals and easier workflow over a long period of time.
```

```ad-todo
